# videoplayer
An website app that plays video. This is a test for me learning Git. There is no app.
Added my first README.md file to the project.
Added via the GITHUB UI which means its been added on the repo.
Now I have to figure out how to update my local master file.
Here goes...

I intend to use this videoplayer app repo as a testing ground.
I am testing option1. To create a remote repo and then upload local files to the repo.
